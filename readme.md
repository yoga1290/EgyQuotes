# Motivation

Sites like [BrainyQuote](http://www.brainyquote.com) and [grabyo](http://about.grabyo.com) are definitely one of the inspiring factors here

VideoQuotes is all about sharing video scenes and quotes from officially verified Youtube channels; this lets people share their favourite video quotes from TV interviews and shows.

#Unzip it
unzip apache-maven*.zip;

#remove the zip file (optional)
rm apache-maven*.zip;

#rename the extracted folder to mvn
mv apache-maven* ~/mvn;

#add maven & java as an environment variables 
echo -e 'export PATH=$PATH:~/mvn/bin\n' >~/.bash_profile;
echo -e 'export JAVA_HOME=~/jdk1.8.0_45\n' >>~/.bash_profile;
#make sure the environment variables are up to date (only needed once in OS X):
source ~/.bash_profile;

#clone this repository:
